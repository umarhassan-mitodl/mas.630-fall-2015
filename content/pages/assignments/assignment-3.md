1.  Generate a list of ten ways a smartphone can detect that its user is in a bad mood. You can give personal examples or examples from people you know (please do not disclose personal identifying information unless you have secured prior permission to do so). For 5 of the 10 items, you are not allowed to use the phone's camera or microphone. Remember that a mood usually lasts more than minutes, so you have some time to look for patterns in the user's life. Item 10 could be "Rate your mood from 1=worst ever ... 7=best ever!" but please don't make more than 1 item be such a direct question.
2.  Make sure you have time to do this part **and** the next question without being interrupted in-between. Before you answer the brainstorm question below, go experience true positive affect. Ask some friend(s) to help you (all in the name of science, yes!) Tell them why this is a good idea based on the Isen reading. For full credit on this homework have a friend email me stating they witnessed you experiencing positive affect, and a line saying why this may matter for your creativity. (So I know you taught them something about what you learned). Make sure they put "MAS630" and YOURLASTNAME in the subject line).
3.  Repeat part 1 but make it a list of ten ways a smartphone can detect that you (or its user) is in a good mood. The same constraints apply: For 5 of the 10 items, you cannot use the phone's camera or microphone. Be creative and feel free to invent something even if you aren't sure it will work! Remember that a mood usually lasts more than minutes, so you have some time to look for patterns in your life (or that of another user).
