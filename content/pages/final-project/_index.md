COUHES for Class Projects (for MIT students)
--------------------------------------------

All projects that involve research on human participants must have the prior approval of the MIT [Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects](https://couhes.mit.edu/) (COUHES). MIT students were also required to pass the "[CITI Certification](https://couhes.mit.edu/training-research-involving-human-subjects)".
