_You will present the first half of your final project on Session 11, including_:

1.  What is the main problem you are addressing or the main idea you are exploring?
2.  What is the closest background work that has been done?
3.  What have you built / designed / examined? For example, if you have an experiment design, show us a picture of the design - perhaps a visual for how the study is set up. Or show us a demo video or live demo of the system you built (visuals / demos are strongly preferred to verbal descriptions).
4.  What part of this is hardest? Illustrate clearly a challenge you have.

_You will present the second half of your final project on Session 12, including_:

1.  (Brief recap) What is the main problem you are addressing or the main idea you are exploring? (Do not be afraid of Repetition, it is good for memory formation - set the context.)
2.  How did you evaluate your work - What tests did you run? How many people? How were they recruited? What did they do? How do you know your test was good - what are your criteria for success?
3.  What results did you find / learn / conclude? Show evidence / statistics to support your work.
4.  Discuss your results: What is strong? What is weak? What would you recommend doing differently if you had time to do it over or if somebody else takes a pass at it? Help us learn from what you learned.
