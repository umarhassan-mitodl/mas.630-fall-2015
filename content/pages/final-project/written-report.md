Finally: Due Session 12, your final report (in PubPub or a .docx or .tex and .pdf of 4-7 pages)

Aim for no more than 4 pages if you're a soloist and no more than 7 if you're on a project team. If not using [PubPub](http://www.pubpub.org/), then use a format for a conference of your choosing. For example, you could use the format for the Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Conference, which uses the [IEEE Computer Society Formatting](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
